## Description

This is a project undertook by some of my classmates and I to create a mock student record system.<br>
This system would hold students transcripts, make them accessible and editable by teachers and allow for review by department heads.

## Installation

Download this repository and run "Interpreter.java" from the command line.<br>
From there you can choose to act as a student, teacher or department.<br>
There is also full documentation inside of the "docs" folder.
